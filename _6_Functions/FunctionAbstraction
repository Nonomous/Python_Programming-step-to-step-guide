# Function abstraction is achieved by separating the use of a function from its implementation. The key to developing
# software is to apply the concept of abstraction. Function abstraction separates the use of a function from
# its implementation. A client program, called simply the client, can use a function without knowing how it is
# implemented. The details of the implementation are encapsulated in the function and hidden from the client that
# invokes the function. This is known as information hiding or  encapsulation.
# If you decide to change the implementation, the client program will not be affected, provided that
# you do not change the function header. The implementation of the function is hidden from the client in a “black
# box. You have already used many of Python’s built-in functions; you used these in client
# programs. You know how to write the code to invoke these functions in your program, but as a user of these
# functions, you are not required to know how they are implemented. The concept of function abstraction can be
# applied to the process of developing programs. When writing a large program, you can use the “divide-and-conquer”
# strategy, also known as Step Wise Refinement.
