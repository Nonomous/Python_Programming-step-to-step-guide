1. You can get input using the input function and convert a string into a numerical value using the eval function.

2. Identifiers are the names used for elements in a program.

3. An identifier is a sequence of characters of any length that consists of letters, digits, underscores (_), and
   asterisk signs (*). An identifier must start with a  letter or an underscore; it cannot start with a digit.
   An identifier cannot be a keyword.

4. Variables are used to  store data in a program.
5. The equal sign (=) is used as the assignment operator.
6. A variable must be assigned a value before it can be used.

7. There are two types of numeric data in Python: integers and real numbers. Integer types (int for short) are for
   whole numbers, and real types (also called float) are for numbers with a decimal  point.

8. Python provides assignment operators that perform numeric operations: + (addition), – (subtraction),
   * (multiplication), / (division), // (integer division), % (remainder), and ** (exponent).

9. The numeric operators in a Python expression are applied the same way as in an arithmetic expression.

10. Python provides augmented  assignment operators: += (addition assignment), –= (subtraction assignment),
    *= (multiplication assignment), /= (float division assignment), //= (integer division assignment), and
    %= (remainder assignment). These operators combine the +, -, *, /, //, and % operators and the assignment operator
    into one augmented operators.

11. When evaluating an expression with values of an int type and a float type, Python automatically converts the
    int value to a float type value.

12. You can convert a float to an int using the int(value) function.
13. System analysis seeks to analyze the data flow and to identify the system’s input and output.
14. System design is the stage when programmers develop a process for obtaining the output from the input.
15. The essence of system analysis and design is input, process, and output. This is called IPO
