1. A Boolean type variable can store a True or False value.
2. The relational operators (<, <=, ==, !=, >, >=), which work with numbers and characters, yield a Boolean value.
3. The Boolean operators and, or, and not operate with Boolean values and variables.

4. When evaluating p1 and p2, Python first evaluates p1 and then evaluates p2 if p1 is True; if p1 is False,
   it does not evaluate p2. When evaluating p1 or p2, PythoN first evaluates p1 and then evaluates p2 if p1 is False;
   if p1 is True, it does not evaluate p2. Therefore, and is referred to as the conditional or short-circuit AND
   operator, and or is referred to as the conditional or short-circuit OR operator.
