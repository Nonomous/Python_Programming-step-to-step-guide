1. Python provides the mathematical functions abs, max, min, pow, and round in the interpreter and the functions fabs,
   ceil, floor, exp, log, sqrt, sin, asin, cos, acos, tan, degrees, and radians in the math module.

2. A string is a sequence of characters. String values can be enclosed in matching single quotes (') or
   double quotes ("). Python does not have a data type for characters; a single-character string represents a character.

3. An escape sequence is a special syntax that begins with the character \ followed by a letter or a combination of
 digits to represent special characters, such as \', \", \t, and \n.

4. The characters ' ', \t, \f, \r, and \n are known as the whitespace characters.

5. All data including numbers and strings are objects in Python. You can invoke methods to perform operations
   on the objects.

6. You can use the format function to format a number or a string and return the result as a string.
